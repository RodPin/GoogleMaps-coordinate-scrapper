# GoogleMaps coordinate scrapper

Currently only working with zoom 17z from google maps

## How to use it

Download Python3 => https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/

Install selenium  => ``` pip install -U selenium ```

Edit ```address.txt``` to search for your addresses

Run => ```python main.py```

### Using .csv

With csv you have to edit ```address``` variable to build your own search

Default separator ```";"```  but you can change it for whatever you want
